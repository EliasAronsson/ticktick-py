The [`TickTickClient`][api.TickTickClient] class is the origin for interactions with the API.
It is important to understand how the local data for your profile is stored and
the names that you will interact with in order to access the different features.

## Logging In

!!! info
    A successful login is required.

!!! success "Initializing Your Session"

    ``` python
    from ticktick import api
    client = api.TickTickClient('username', 'password')  # Enter correct username and password
    ```

    Once you have initialized your session, all interactions will occur through the instance, in this case: ```client```

##State

The `state` public member is a dictionary that contains objects linked to your TickTick profile. The dictionary is
automatically updated and synced when changes are made through the API.

!!! example "`state`"

    === "Members"

        The lists are comprised of dictionaries that contain all the fields for each type of TickTick object: tasks, tags, etc.

        | Member        | Type |   Contains                          |
        | -----------   | -----|------------------------------------  |
        | `tasks`       | `list` |     All uncompleted task objects |
        | `tags`        | `list` |     All tag objects |
        | `projects`       | `list` |     All project objects |
        | `project_folders`| `list` |     All project folder objects|

    === "Accessing"

        Members can be accessed by normal dictionary indexing using the member strings.

        ```python
        # Assumes that 'client' is the name that references the TickTickClient class.

        uncompleted_tasks = client.state['tasks']
        all_tags = client.state['tags']
        ```

    === "Example Task Object"

        ```python
        {'id': '5ff24e4b8f08904035b304d9', 'projectId': 'inbox416323287', 'sortOrder': -1099511627776, 'title': 'Get Groceries', 'content': '', 'startDate': '2021-05-06T21:30:00.000+0000', 'dueDate': '2021-05-06T21:30:00.000+0000', 'timeZone': 'America/Los_Angeles', 'isFloating': False, 'isAllDay': False, 'reminders': [], 'priority': 0, 'status': 0, 'items': [], 'modifiedTime': '2021-01-03T23:07:55.004+0000', 'etag': 'ol2zesef', 'deleted': 0, 'createdTime': '2021-01-03T23:07:55.011+0000', 'creator': 359368200, 'kind': 'TEXT'}
        ```

##Functionality

Different functionality can be accessed through different public members of the `TickTickClient` instance:

!!! example "Functionality"

    === "Method Managers"

        Accessing the methods for each type of member is easy. It is in this format:

        `client`(or whatever name references the `TickTickClient` instance).`manager`(members in table below).`method()`

        | Member   | Functionality         |
        | ----------- | -------------------|
        | `task`      |       Task Methods |
        | `tag`       |       Tag Methods |
        | `project`   |       List Methods |

    === "Example Usage"

        ```python
        # Assumes that 'client' is the name that references the TickTickClient instance.

        created_task = client.task.create('My Created Task')
        deleted_project = client.project.delete(project_id)
        ```

        Make sure to check the individual documentation for the different method managers.

!!! info "Other Public Members"

    === "Useful Members"

        | Member   |     Type   |Description                          |
        | ----------- | --------|---------------------------- |
        | `profile_id`| `str`         | ID assigned to your profile |
        | `inbox_id`  | `str`         | Inbox ID assigned to your profile|
        | `time_zone` | `str`         | Timezone string linked to your TickTick profile |
        | `state` |      `dict`       | Holds all the item objects in your profile (described above)|

    === "Members That Shouldn't Be Messed With"

        Messing with these values could produce unwanted effects.

        | Member   |     Type   |Description                          |
        | ----------- | --------|---------------------------- |
        | `access_token`| `str`         | Instance token generated by TickTick for your session. |
        | `cookies`  | `dict`         | Cookies required for your session.|

## Useful Methods

`TickTickClient` has a lot of helper functions in its documentation...however these should be the only of use methods to you:

!!! tip
    It's recommended that you look at the documentation for these three methods to see how to obtain / delete objects from
    the local `state` dictionary - an important feature that will be useful when updating / deleting TickTick objects remotely.

- [`delete_from_local_state`][api.TickTickClient.delete_from_local_state]
- [`get_by_fields`][api.TickTickClient.get_by_fields]
- [`get_by_id`][api.TickTickClient.get_by_id]
- [`get_by_etag`][api.TickTickClient.get_by_etag]

## That's It!

That's all the required information for how to get started with the API! To see how to use individual features, check these out next:

- [Tasks](tasks.md)
- [Projects](projects.md)
- [Tags](tags.md)
